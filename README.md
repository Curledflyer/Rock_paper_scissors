# Rock_paper_scissors
First Javascript project

I will attempt to break the project down into small pieces and tackle each issue as it comes up.

This project will be used to apply my learning in Javascript to a more complex piece of work than I have dealt with up to now. 

It will also be used as a way to practice problem solving as a whole, tackling errors efficiently, and debug.
